# TriviaGame

This game has ten questions that always appear in the same order. After answering the questions, user can restart. The choices are always the same but the order in which they are displayed is not. 

To accomplish the random order of choices, a Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm was used. The theory is understood but the code is not. The code of my shuffle function was copied and pasted. It is not understood by the author why it works but testing shows that it does.
